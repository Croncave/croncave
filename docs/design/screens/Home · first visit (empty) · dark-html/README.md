# Home · first visit (empty) · dark — design reference

This is a design mockup created in a visual design tool (an appifact
design canvas), exported as a standalone page. Treat it as a REFERENCE
MOCKUP, not production code: the markup and inline styles carry the
design's precise values — colors, font sizes, spacing, radii, shadows,
layout — which an implementation should replicate faithfully in its own
components and styling system rather than copy wholesale.

## Contents

- `HomeEmptyDark.dc.html` — the artboard (a Design Component: an `<x-dc>`
  template + a small logic class). The values to replicate live in its
  inline `style="…"` attributes and the `<helmet><style>` block.
- `HomeEmpty.dc.html` — referenced resource
- `ds/croncave/components/bundle.css` — referenced resource
- `ds/croncave/tokens.css` — referenced resource
- `Main.dc.html` — referenced resource
- `support.js`, `vendor/react*.js` — the runtime that renders the
  component in a browser; not part of the design.

## Viewing

Serve the folder (e.g. `python3 -m http.server`) and open `HomeEmptyDark.dc.html`;
some browsers block the scripts over file://.
